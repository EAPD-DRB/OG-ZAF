# Matching Labor, Wealth, and Income Moments

[TO BE COMPLETED: As we note in Chapter {numref}`Chap_LfEarn`, we match the Gini coefficient of the income distribution through our calibration of the lifecyle productivity profile.  With survey data on hours worked by age, we can adjust the $\chi^n_s$ parameter to match the lifecycle profile of labor supply. The $\beta^j$ and $\chi^b_j$ parameters can be used to match the distribution of wealth given survey or administrative data describing its distribution.]
