    "Demographics are a key component of the macroeconmic model. {cite}`Nishiyama:2015` and {cite}`DeBackerEtAl:2019` have recently shown that demographic dynamics are likely the biggest influence on macroeconomic time series, exhibiting more influence than fiscal variables or household preference parameters.\n",

    "In this chapter, we characterize the equations and parameters that govern the transition dynamics of the population distribution by age. In `OG-ZAF`, we take the approach of taking mortality rates and fertility rates from outside estimates. But we estimate our immigration rates as residuals using the mortality rates, fertility rates, and at least two consecutive periods of population distribution data. This approach makes sense if one is modeling a country in which one is not confident in the immigration rate data. If the country has good immigration data, then the immigration residual approach we describe below can be skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define $\\omega_{s,t}$ as the number of households of age $s$ alive at time $t$. A measure $\\omega_{1,t}$ of households is born in each period $t$ and live for up to $E+S$ periods, with $S\\geq 4$.[^calibage_note] Households are termed \"youth\", and do not participate in market activity during ages $1\\leq s\\leq E$. The households enter the workforce and economy in period $E+1$ and remain in the workforce until they unexpectedly die or live until age $s=E+S$. We model the population with households age $s\\leq E$ outside of the workforce and economy in order most closely match the empirical population dynamics.\n",

Now the Perron-Frobenius Theorem for irreducible matrices gives us that the equilibrium vector is unique.\n",

Since our matrix $\\bf\\Omega$ is aperiodic, the steady state growth rate is the unique largest eigenvalue in magnitude. This implies that almost all initial vectors will converge to this eigenvector under iteration.\n",

That is to say, that after 160 periods, given the estimated mortality, fertility, and immigration rates, the population has not achieved its steady state. For convergence in our solution method over a reasonable time horizon, we want the population to reach a stationary distribution after $T$ periods. To do this, we artificially impose that the population distribution in period $t=120$ is the steady-state. As can be seen from {numref}`Figure %s <FigOrigVsFixSSpop>`, this assumption is not very restrictive. {numref}`Figure %s <FigImmRateChg>` shows the change in immigration rates that would make the period $t=120$ population distribution equal be the steady-state. The maximum absolute difference between any two corresponding immigration rates in {numref}`Figure %s <FigImmRateChg>` is very small.\n",
